# pinetrest: know before you go!
pinetrest is a maps-based social media app for outdoorsmen, where users are able to see the conditions of various trails, parks, and lookouts in real-time by other users.

## the problem?
the photos you see online can't be trusted! this is especially the case for outdoor areas, where different conditions can cause the area to be extremely different from what you expected it to be - often disappointing.

## the solution?
with pinetrest (pine tree + pintrest ðŸ˜„), you are able to see what trail conditions are like in real-time, as well as make your own posts for others to see!

our frontend was built with react and tailwind, backend with javascript and firebase, and using the google maps api.

## looking to the future: expanding
there is definitely room to build out this app even as a general social media app. we believe that people would enjoy seeing where their friends are and see what areas are popular at that time based on location.
