this project was created at hack the north 2023 in waterloo, on by dorian chen, rui chen, and bryant zheng.

## the problem ðŸ”Ž?
the photos you see online can't be trusted! this is especially the case for outdoor areas, where different conditions can cause the area to be extremely different from what you expected it to be - often disappointing.

## the solution ðŸ§ ?
with Pinetrest (pine tree + Pinterest ðŸ˜„), you are able to see what trail conditions are like in real-time, as well as make your own posts for others to see!

our frontend was built with react and tailwind, backend with javascript and firebase, and using the google maps api.

## looking to the future ðŸ¤–: expanding
there is definitely room to build out this app even as a general social media app. we believe that people would enjoy seeing where their friends are and see what areas are popular at that time based on location.

## challenges we ran into ðŸ¤•
the main challenge that we faced early on was that we could not get images to be uploaded correctly to our full-stack application. we tried many different methods and self-taught ourselves many different techniques, however we still were not able to get these images to upload properly.

eventually, we sought out the help of a mentor, who gave us a bit of direction. we were then able to find a middleware called multer, and so we were able to overcome this challenge.

this challenge enforced in us that while it is definitely correct to try to solve problems on our own to the best of our abilities, it is also good to know when it is more worthwhile to ask for a bit of help!
