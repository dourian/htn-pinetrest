# Pinetrest ðŸŒ²: know before you go!
pinetrest is a maps-based social media app for outdoorsmen, where users are able to see the conditions of various trails, parks, and lookouts in real-time by other users.

## meet the team!
this project was created at hack the north 2023 in waterloo, ontario by dorian chen, rui chen, and bryant zheng.

## the problem ðŸ”Ž?
the photos you see online can't be trusted! this is especially the case for outdoor areas, where different conditions can cause the area to be extremely different from what you expected it to be - often disappointing.

## the solution ðŸ§ ?
with Pinetrest (pine tree + Pinterest ðŸ˜„), you are able to see what trail conditions are like in real-time, as well as make your own posts for others to see!

our frontend was built with react and tailwind, backend with javascript and firebase, and using the google maps api.

## our use of google cloud

## our use of github
our entire team collaborated on a github repository. using the pull and version control systems of github to the fullest, we were able to efficiently and effectively working together to this successful goal. as well, we were able to create an organized hub for all of our work, including an in-depth README markdown file regarding this project and the experience that we had here! finally, all good applications deserved to be deployed, and what better way to do that with github's own github pages. all in all, we used github in near all aspects of our weekend of hacking here at hack the north 2023.

## looking to the future ðŸ¤–: expanding
there is definitely room to build out this app even as a general social media app. we believe that people would enjoy seeing where their friends are and see what areas are popular at that time based on location.

## challenges we ran into ðŸ¤•
the main challenge that we faced early on was that we could not get images to be uploaded correctly to our full-stack application. we tried many different methods and self-taught ourselves many different techniques, however we still were not able to get these images to upload properly.

eventually, we sought out the help of a mentor, who gave us a bit of direction. we were then able to find a middleware called multer, and so we were able to overcome this challenge.

this challenge enforced in us that while it is definitely correct to try to solve problems on our own to the best of our abilities, it is also good to know when it is more worthwhile to ask for a bit of help!
